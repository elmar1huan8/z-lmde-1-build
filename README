This is the repository for transforming LMDE into Swift Linux.

To download this repository and other repositories, open a regular user shell and enter:

sh preinstall.sh

NOTE: The scripts for building Diet Swift Linux and the special editions ASSUME that you have already created Regular Swift Linux.  If you've made changes to the Regular Swift Linux script, you MUST rebuild Regular Swift Linux to ensure that these changes carry over into Diet Swift Linux and the special editions.
